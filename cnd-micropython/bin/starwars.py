# The star wars ascii data is output to an 80 x 18 CHARACTER terminal window.
# Out display is 128x64 PIXELS, so we have to do some scaling.
# I decided each character should take up 2x4 pixels, meaning the size of our 'window'
# would be 160 x 72 pixels big.  If we ignore the pixels that fall outside this area
# (Most of the action happens in middle of the screen anyway) then we can fill the display
# with pretty action without doing too much maths (which might be a bit slow)

# This lookup table allows us to map the ascii-art of the movie
# to a 2x4 pixel block on screen.
# Basically, if the server sends a '<' char, then:
# This maps tothe values 0x6 and 0x9
# Which are 2+4 (6) and 8+1 (9)
# So the pixels become:
#  1  □  █
#  2  █  □
#  4  █  □
#  8  □  █

# Micropython bytes handing is a teensy bit weird (this might just be python3)
# If you index into a bytes array, you get an integer value.

# from the telnet connection will be 4 pixels high, so we need to buffer up 2 lines
# worth of ascii art at a time, so they can be sent to the display in one go.
